READTHIS: i could not find the entire code and could only find this portion through a cropped screenshot on my computer. so the code might
not include everything but i think most of the important stuff is there and it should kinda make sense. 
the code had to take in a string with letters corresponding to a color based fibonacci clock. it had to convert the string into the actual time.
